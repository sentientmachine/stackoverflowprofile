Here is Elon Musk saying that if he were 22 today, he would <br> 
be focusing on Artificial intelligence, Genetics and a high<br>
bandwidth API interface between computers and the brain.<br>

The delayed choice quantum eraser experiment appears to prove that all of reality is rendered like an overhead projector on a wall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzAQ36b9dzs  until the full lifetime of the photon that travels at the full speed of light comes to permanent rest on something that has a permanent specific impact on the universe, the possibilities of where the photon go are in a state of superposition where all possibilities are explored, interfering with itself until final collapse, where infinite possibilities are reduced to one possibility.  It appears to be the mechanism that not only defines the speed of chemical reactions, but of the higgs field and the fabric of space.  Without this, vision would not be possible since light from every surface would enter your eye from every possible direction, making everything pure white.  The experiment shows that there's a preprocessing step before the universe ticks its clock and renders the 'next frame' of the universe.

The pulses that transmit along the Axons and Dendrites of <br>
neurons in the Brain pass meaningful information in the <br>
strobe, tone, resonace and shape of the waveform.  Neurons<br>
are doing much more than passing bits, they are passing <br>
waveforms.  It is also possible that neurons are harnessing<br>
quantum mechanical phenomenoa like quantum tunneling and <br>
retrocausality shown in expirments such as in the <br>
